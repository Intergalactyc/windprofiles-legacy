WindProfiles: GLWind Wind Profile Characterization
====================================

## THIS IS LEGACY CODE

See the following for the current code:
- [windprofiles](https://github.com/intergalactyc/windprofiles) : the new core package
- [kcc-windprofiles](https://github.com/intergalactyc/kcc-windprofiles) : KCC 106-meter met tower data analysis
- [ttu-windprofiles](https://github.com/intergalactyc/ttu-windprofiles) : TTU 200-meter met tower data analysis

Extension of the old [glwind_codebase](https://github.com/windysensors/glwind_codebase/), focusing on the [wind profile analysis/characterization project](https://engineering.csuohio.edu/glwind_reu/wind-profile-characterization-based-surface-terrain-and-atmospheric-thermal-stability) for the [GLWind program](https://engineering.csuohio.edu/glwind_reu/glwind_reu). Currently being worked on at Texas Tech University as a continuation of work from Summer 2024.

Required Python packages
-----------------------
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tqdm
scipy
windrose

Optional Recommended Python packages (needed if using samples in `analyze/`)
-----------------------
geopy
fastparquet
astral
*note: currently, pyproject.toml is set up to require these as dependencies*

Structuring
-----------------------
Code up until now is in `src_old/`. Most of the stuff in `src_old/old` isn't really useful anymore. I'll note that the `newsonic.py` is not currently functional. Right now, `combine.py` puts the KCC data together, `reduce.py` does basic QC and then computes useful values, and `plots.py` (as well as `roses.py` for some wind rose stuff) does a strange mix of analysis and plotting. `sonic.py` is being updated into `newsonic.py` to do an okay job handling analysis of ultrasonic data, but this is even more of a WIP. `helper_functions.py` has a variety of common statistical, scientific, or purely convenience functions used by any and all of the others.

I'm now putting things together in the `windprofiles` package. Ideally this will replace `src` at some point. Within it are the main modules, as well as a subpackage `lib/` containing files with common functions - this is basically the old `helper_functions.py` split up into smaller chunks.

Analysis using the `windprofiles` package is in the `analysis` directory: `kcc.py` handles the analysis of the Cedar Rapids KCC met tower data.

If for some unlikely reason you are using this while I'm working on it, feel free to contact me at the above email with questions.

Package install
----------------------
To install from source, from the `WindProfiles` directory run `python3 -m pip install .`. To install in editing mode pass the flag -e to pip install: `python3 -m pip install -e .`. This will make it so that local changes are immediately reflected in usage of the package, rather than requiring reinstall/update every time you make a change locally - useful in development.

Usage
----------------------
See `analysis/kcc.py` for an example of using the package. This can be run from scratch by calling `python3 ./analysis/kcc.py -r`, omitting the `-r` after first use to not re-load and re-compute all data (instead just repeating the further analysis and plotting). You will, unless you are Elliott, also have to pass `-p <PARENT-DIRECTORY-PATH>` specifying the path to the directory within which a subdirectory `data` containing the properly formatted `/KCC_SlowData/` directory exists. (If you need this, which you likely do because the format of the files matters, contact me at the above email!)
